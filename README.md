The Generative AI–Based Personalized Learning Assistant is a web application designed to support students with smart, exam-focused learning tools. It combines features like a doubt solver, quiz generator, notes summarizer, study planner, and quiz-based progress tracking to create a complete learning companion. Instead of using general AI tools, students get structured academic support tailored to their studies. The system helps learners quickly understand concepts, revise effectively, and track their improvement, making learning more organized, interactive, and personalized.
